    description: |
      [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com) is a certificate authority that issues free TLS certificats.
      [cert-manager](/components/cert-manager) uses ZeroSSL to issue valid TLS certifices for the Demo environment
    notes: |
      ZeroSSL is an alternative to [Let`s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) that doesn't impose the rate limits and
      certificate issuing limits that Let's Encrypt does, making it suitable for use with an ephemeral Kubernetes
      cluster.
